Container support in Azure Cognitive Services allows developers to use the same rich APIs that are available in Azure, and enables flexibility in where to deploy and host the services that come with Docker containers.

Azure Cognitive Services provides several Docker containers that let you use the same APIs that are available in Azure, on-premises. Using these containers gives you the flexibility to bring Cognitive Services closer to your data for compliance, security or other operational reasons.

Containerization is an approach to software distribution in which an application or service, including its dependencies & configuration, is packaged together as a container image. With little or no modification, a container image can be deployed on a container host. Containers are isolated from each other and the underlying operating system, with a smaller footprint than a virtual machine. Containers can be instantiated from container images for short-term tasks, and removed when no longer needed.  

### Features and benefits
**Immutable infrastructure:** Enable DevOps teams' to leverage a consistent and reliable set of known system parameters, while being able to adapt to change. Containers provide the flexibility to pivot within a predictable ecosystem and avoid configuration drift.

**Control over data:** Choose where your data gets processed by Cognitive Services. This can be essential if you can't send data to the cloud but need access to Cognitive Services APIs. Support consistency in hybrid environments â€“ across data, management, identity, and security.

**Control over model updates:** Flexibility in versioning and updating of models deployed in their solutions.
Portable architecture: Enables the creation of a portable application architecture that can be deployed on Azure, on-premises and the edge. Containers can be deployed directly to Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Instances, or to a Kubernetes cluster deployed to Azure Stack. For more information, see Deploy Kubernetes to Azure Stack.

**High throughput / low latency:** Provide customers the ability to scale for high throughput and low latency requirements by enabling Cognitive Services to run physically close to their application logic and data. Containers do not cap transactions per second (TPS) and can be made to scale both up and out to handle demand if you provide the necessary hardware resources.

**Scalability:** With the ever growing popularity of containerization and container orchestration software, such as Kubernetes; scalability is at the forefront of technological advancements. Building on a scalable cluster foundation, application development caters to high availability.

### Billing
*copied from docs* The container needs the billing argument values to run. These values allow the container to connect to the billing endpoint. The container reports usage about every 10 to 15 minutes. If the container doesn't connect to Azure within the allowed time window, the container continues to run but doesn't serve queries until the billing endpoint is restored. The connection is attempted 10 times at the same time interval of 10 to 15 minutes. If it can't connect to the billing endpoint within the 10 tries, the container stops serving requests.

In addition, some containers are supported in Cognitive Services All-In-One offering resource keys. You can create one single Cognitive Services All-In-One resource and use the same billing key across supported services for the following services:

Computer Vision
Face
LUIS
Text Analytics

### Generenic workflow
- Create the resource in Azure
- Get the endpoint 
- Get the API Key
- Find the container for the service
- Deploy the container
- Use the container endpoint as you would use the api resource

Optional you can mount your own storage and connect [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)?WT.mc_id=aiml-12167-heboelma.
